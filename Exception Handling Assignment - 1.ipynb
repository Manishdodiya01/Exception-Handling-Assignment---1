    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exception occurs, the interpreter raises an object that represents the error, and the normal program execution is halted. These exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as when trying to divide by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or attempting to call a method on an object that doesn't support it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be categorized into two main types: built-in exceptions and user-defined exceptions. Python provides a variety of built-in exception classes that cover different types of errors. These include `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are a type of error that occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language syntax. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the code is actually executed. Syntax errors prevent the code from being run and must be fixed before the program can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Timing of Detection**:\n",
    "   - **Exceptions**: Detected during program execution when an exceptional condition occurs.\n",
    "   - **Syntax Errors**: Detected during the parsing phase, before program execution begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cause**:\n",
    "   - **Exceptions**: Caused by runtime conditions, such as division by zero or attempting to access a non-existent file.\n",
    "   - **Syntax Errors**: Caused by violations of Python language rules, like missing colons, incorrect indentation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detection Mechanism**:\n",
    "   - **Exceptions**: Raised by the interpreter when a specific condition is met (e.g., trying to access an undefined variable).\n",
    "   - **Syntax Errors**: Detected by the interpreter when it's processing the code to create a program's abstract syntax tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling**:\n",
    "   - **Exceptions**: Can be caught and handled using `try` and `except` blocks. This allows the program to gracefully handle errors and continue execution.\n",
    "   - **Syntax Errors**: Since they prevent the code from being executed, they must be fixed directly in the code before the program can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are raised during the runtime of a program when an exceptional condition occurs, while syntax errors are detected by the interpreter before program execution due to violations of the Python language's syntax rules."
